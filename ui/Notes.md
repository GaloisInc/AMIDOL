## TODO

This page helps Max keep track of UI development.

### Features:

Before Milestone 2:

1. Create and remove nodes
2. Create and remove links
3. Edit node labels
4. Edit link labels
5. Generate and send JSON

After:

\6. Receive and display response (chart!)
\7. Select and assign node images

### Pending fixes and improvements:

- Node image code is commented out
- Nice affordances for node and link selection
- Key input for deletion (etc)
- Use Dict rather than List for both nodes and edges
- Factor out common label view code
- Layering: translucent labels on top
- Adjust arrow lengths and style
- Adjust label positions and style
- Style usage instructions and buttons
- More consistent naming and code organization
