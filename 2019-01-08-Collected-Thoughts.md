# Key Cognitive Modeling and Machine Learning Challenges
* UI/UX side
* Understanding the actual goals and outcomes
  * Avoid ML/CM just for sales, or to use cool tools.
  * Need a good application.
* Seemless integration of AI/ML/CM technology
  * Don't require experts to learn.
* Get rid of bespoke qualities - make models reusable
* Make modeling usable for domain experts with minimal or no new training.
  * Machine partners need to adapt to the user
* Explainability, ability to drill down on a topic, evidence, counter-factuals.
  * Episodic memory reconstruction to step down through the decision making process

* Have ML/AI not adjudicate, but indicate potential problems.
  * Tampa HQ for (SETCOM?) - processes information from human sources
  * Nearly a day job to divest information on what happened.

* Bias against negative results
  * ML doesn't sell the incentivization process
  * ML can't train on the absence of information
  * How about explainable operations?
  * Human decision science - knowing what tools to apply and not to apply
    * Sometimes cannot tell you why

* Gary Kline - techniques for cognitive task analysis
* Cost of documenting your failures

* Formal, end-to-end solutions with portability and scalability

* Avoid tool creep and the "parking lot" of incompatible solutions

* A lot of our understanding is based on human assumptions, AI/ML may find there are uninteresting elements in our understanding.  How can ML/AI suggest refinements that make a better minimal viable product.

* Software standards/enterprise constructs

* In the government people will stop not at the first resistance, or the first sign of resistance, but the first sign of the first sign of resistance.

* Data - big problem.
  * Enough data
  * Good data
  * Relevant data
  * ML on the edge - coming up with very specific models trained on very specific data
  * Data driven challenges for ML - how will they deal with spread out architecture
