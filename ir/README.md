### Building

You will need to have:
  - a recent version of the Oracle [JDK] version 8 (http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html)
  - the latest version of [SBT](http://www.scala-sbt.org/) installed and on your path

Then, you can use (from this directory)

    $ sbt compile    # ... to compile
    $ sbt run        # ... to compile and run
    $ sbt test       # ... to compile and run tests
