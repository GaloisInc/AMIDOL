## Model Objectives

**Objective**: Identify the *basic reproduction number* associated with an infection, also known as R0, or *r nought*.  R0 was first used in 1952 when studying malaria and is a measure of the potential for an infection to spread through a population.  If R0 < 1, then the infection will die out in the long run.  If R0 > 1, then the infection will spread.  The higher the value of R0, the more difficult it is to control an epidemic.

Given a 100% effective vaccine, the proportion of the population that needs to be vaccinated is 1 - 1/R0, meaning that R0 can be used to plan disease response.  This assumes a homogenous population, and contains many other simplifying assumptions and does not generalize to more complex numbers.

You can read more about the application of R0 to [H1N1](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/324/5934/1557) and [Ebola](http://currents.plos.org/outbreaks/article/obk-14-0036-early-epidemic-dynamics-of-the-west-african-2014-ebola-outbreak-estimates-derived-with-a-simple-two-parameter-model/).
