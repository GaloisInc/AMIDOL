## Storyboarding of Demo

![Clay Slide on Demo]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link /W3Collaboration/clay-arizona-slide-06-18.jpg %})

```
Fortran -> GrFN <-> SemanticModels.jl
            â†“
          Galois
```

* GrFN: Representation of the predicates in the conditionals, can it be better exposed?
* Lambda functions not being captured explicitly.

### Demo Targets

* An ABM model of SIR/SEIR.
* Compare to ODEs?
* Sources of data
  * Paper scraping
  * Code translation
  * Picture translation

## Structured Knowledge Layer
* Embedding domain level knowledge in the SKL.
  * Are we storing everything we need to store?  What else might we store?  How should we store it?
* Because dimensional analysis is algebraic, there are good ways to reason about units, and expressions about units.
