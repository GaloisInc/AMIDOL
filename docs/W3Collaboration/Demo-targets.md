# User Stories and Demo Target
- User story
  - Parameter estimation of infection rate (corresponding to virus identification) for a single infection.
  - Multiple parallel viral infections - with "curve fitting" to data to predict/determine the set of viruses.
  - Multi-stage infection SEEEIR type model
    - James will send paper.
    - Ebola based multi-stage exposure, with different symptoms at different phases
    - Forking process where you could die in any of the infectious stages
    - HIV/cancer as well
    - HPV
- User explicit model - designed as a formulation (User-defined Model)
- Code extracted model - dug out of extant code (Extracted Model)
- Models generated by transforming the above via metaprogramming (Generated Model)
- X models of influenza, identification of degrees of freedom for model transformation
  - Degrees of freedom are inputs to the system through formulation
  - Constant identification through human-machine teaming
- Model equivalence
- Code generation in multiple solvers

- Capabilities
  - Time series as a model
  - SNOWMED/ICD9 ontology mapping
  - Templeting of formulation elements
  - Generation of formulation from Julia ASTs w/ grounding
  - Generation of model from formulation
  - Generation of implementation from model

- GTRI - Take SIR model, emit SEIR
  - Exposure data in CDC data set
  - Parameter estimation code - given time series and data, curve fit.


- A Model is a morphism between two sets, for every element of the domain it picks a set of elements of the co-domain
  - Picking out elements of the domain: give me the subsequence.
  - Pre-composing - selecting the time series, Post-composing - selecting rewards

- Empirical model, vs. explicit model?
