* Report Contents
  * Definition of initial VDSOL for epidemic outbreak and response. Design VDSOL specification for initial domain based on published research, focus on models of H5N1 and H3N2 incidents and responses.
  * Design and development of initial AMIDOL Abstract Functional Interface. Specification of AFI primitives: state variables, actions, and predicates.
  * Initial AMIDOL machine-assisted inference engine development for prognostic queries on models defined in the VDSOL.
  * Investigation of epidemic response domain model. Implementation of Epidemic Response domain model for H5N1 and H3N2. Experiments on counter-factual analysis from models derived from these domains, and to build user stories on analysis, planning, and crisis response.
  * Definition of correctness, sensitivity, and uncertainty metrics. Communication of these results using the AFI to provide context in the ontology described by the VDSOL to improve practitioner understanding.
