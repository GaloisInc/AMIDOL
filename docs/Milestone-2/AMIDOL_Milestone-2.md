Introduction
============

The construction of computational models is an important practice for
scientists, engineers, policy makers, and other domain experts as it
provides a way to make formal predictions based on a formal expectation
of system behavior, and allows practitioners to test hypotheses and
explain phenomena in complex systems. The process of building suitable
models, however, is a laborious one which requires diverse teams of
experts, significant manual effort, and typical results in models with
severe limitations, low performability, and little reusability or
generalizability. Such models are not only costly to produce, both in
time and effort, but are also prone to errors, difficult to verify, and
do not utilize best practices in software development.

[<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">AMIDOL</span>]{} seeks to
improve the problems inherent to modern machine-assisted inference with
two high-level goals: 1) improving the ability of domain experts to
build and maintain models and 2) improving the explainability and
agility of the results of machine-inference. The techniques applied to
achieve these goals incorporate abstract intermediate representations,
semantic knowledge representation and binding in graph structures,
traditional machine learning and model solution techniques, with
intuitive model generation giving meaning to the semi-formal diagrams
already being generated by domain experts.

Current modeling formalisms are often specified in formal languages
which seem arcane and unnatural to domain experts, but have unambigous
formal meaning with defined execution semantics. By contrast domain
experts have naturally developed visual semi-formal ways of describing
the systems they study, such as those indicated in Figure
\[Fig:Semi-formal\], but which lack semantic meaning, executability, and
are often ambiguous.

$$\begin{aligned}
\frac{d\ tat}{dt} &=& -dtt \cdot tat\\
\frac{d\ nRNA}{dt} &=& \frac{(b + v \cdot tat)}{k + tat} - ex \cdot nRNA - dr \cdot nRNA\\
\frac{d\ cRNA}{dt} &=& ex \cdot nRNA - dr \cdot cRNA\\
\frac{d\ P}{dt} &=& \frac{vp \cdot cRNA}{kp + cRNA} - dp \cdot P\end{aligned}$$

[[@nurse2008life] Paul Nurse (2008)]{} “There should be a concerted
programme …which will require both the development of the appropriate
languages to describe information processing in biological systems and
the generation of more effective methods to translate biochemical
descriptions into the functioning of the logic circuits that underpin
biological phenomena.”
